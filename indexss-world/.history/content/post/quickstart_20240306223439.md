这是一篇测试博文。

我的上一个博客，shilinli.com，由于域名续费太贵而没有续费，于是被投机者嗅探到，变成了一个垃圾小说网站，还给我发邮件威胁赎回，这也提醒我使用一个免费的博客服务。

免费服务第一个想到的肯定就是github page，提供免费的静态网页托管。我看到大多数人都在使用Hexo博客系统，但我选择了Hugo。主要的原因就是它的广告语：

“The world’s fastest framework for building websites”

Hugo 依靠Go语言进行开发，真的是快啊。

但它目前也有问题，Hugo提供了一个很棒的命令行命令来创建博文，但是他并没有提供命令去删除博文。你必须手动去删除你原来的博文，这一点比较烦。但其实这不是个大问题，毕竟我还是很少删文章的，能放到博客上面来也一定是写的比较好的内容。

This is a test blog post.

My previous blog, shilinli.com, was not renewed due to the expensive domain renewal fee. As a result, it was discovered by speculators and turned into a junk novel website. They even sent me threatening emails for redemption, which reminded me to use a free blogging service.

The first free service that came to mind was definitely GitHub Pages, which provides free static web hosting. I saw that most people were using the Hexo blogging system, but I chose Hugo. The main reason is its slogan:

"The world's fastest framework for building websites"

Hugo is developed based on Go language and it's really fast.

However, it also has issues at the moment. Hugo provides a great command line command to create blog posts, but it does not provide a command to delete them. You have to manually delete your original blog posts, which can be annoying. But in fact this is not a big problem because I rarely delete articles since anything that can be put on the blog must be well-written content.
