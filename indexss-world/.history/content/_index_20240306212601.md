Hi, I'm Linli Shi (史林立), AKA **indexss** on the internet. I'm a:

- **CS Student**

  I'm pursuing a dual B.Sci in Computer Science and B.Eng. My university education began at [Central South University, China](https://www.csu.edu.cn/), and concluded at the [University of Birmingham, UK](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/).

- **Researcher**

  I value eye contact's significance in human communication and believe similar principles apply to robots, advocating for gaze estimation technology to boost robot interactivity. 

  I am a member of the [Apple Lab](https://www.csuios.club/) at CSU, The year here is the fastest growing year for me. 
  
  I'm thankful for Prof. [Mingming Lu](https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/lumingming/en/index.htm)'s mentorship at CSU in 2022-2023 on AI and DL, and am now researching gaze estimation, computer vision, and robotics with Prof. [Yihua Cheng](https://yihua.zone/) at the University of Birmingham.

- **Open-source enthusiast**

  I’ve always been passionate about sharing the code and solutions I worked out. I have also organized [openKyline](https://www.openkylin.top/downloads/os-en.html) open source salon with other students from CSU and the Open Source Association, contributing to the promotion of the Open Kyline system.

- and **Keyboard Politician**

  I'm passionate about AI-assisted market regulation and precise resource allocation as solutions to conflicts and a proponent of industrial development as a means to address development issues. Open to debates!
