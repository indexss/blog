Hi, I'm Linli Shi, AKA **indexss** on the internet. I'm a:

- **Student**

  I'm pursuing a dual B.Sci in Computer Science and B.Eng. My university education began at Central South University, China, and concluded at the University of Birmingham, UK.

- **Researcher**

  I value eye contact's significance in human communication and believe similar principles apply to robots, advocating for gaze estimation technology to boost robot interactivity. 

  I'm thankful for Prof. Mingming Lu's mentorship at CSU in 2022-2023 on AI and DL, and am now researching gaze estimation, computer vision, and robotics with Prof. Yihua Cheng at the University of Birmingham.

- **Open-source enthusiast**

  Iâ€™ve always been passionate about sharing the code and solutions I worked out. I have also organized Open Kyline open source salon with other students from CSU and the open source association, contributing to the promotion of the Open Kyline system.

- and **Keyboard Politician**

  I'm passionate about AI-assisted market regulation and precise resource allocation as solutions to conflicts and a proponent of industrial development as a means to address development issues. Open to debates!
