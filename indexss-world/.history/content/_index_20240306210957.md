Hi, I'm Linli Shi, AKA **indexss** on the internet. I'm a:

- **Student**

  
I'm pursuing a dual B.Sci in Computer Science and B.Eng, with knowledge in digital and analog circuits, groups, and Boolean algebra. My university education began at Central South University, China, and concluded at the University of Birmingham, UK.

- **Researcher**

  I believe in the power of eye contact. In communication between people, eye contact conveys a lot of information that cannot be transmitted through words. I think robots are the same. I believe that using gaze estimation technology to empower robots and enhance their interactions is an important way to improve the interactivity of robots.

  I am very grateful for the guidance of Prof. Mingming Lu in 2022-2023 in CSU, who introduced me to AI and DL, and also taught me some academic skills. Currently, I am doing some research with Professor Yihua Cheng at the University of Birmingham, focus on Gaze Estimation, Computer Vision and Robotic.

- **Open-source enthusiast**

  Iâ€™ve always been passionate about sharing the code and solutions I worked out. I have also organized Open Kyline open source salon with other students from CSU and the open source association, contributing to the promotion of the Open Kyline system.

- and **Keyboard Politician**

  I really like this identity. I have my own opinions on many policies, and I believe that AI-assisted market regulation and precise resource allocation are the ultimate solution to many conflicts. I am also a supporter of industrial development, believing that development is the key to solving development issues. Welcome to debate with me!
